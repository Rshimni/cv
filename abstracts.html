      <h3>Bachelor's thesis: Deformation Analysis of a Pressurized Cylinder Based on Surface Elasticity Theory</h3>
<p> The aim of my thesis was to analyze the effects of surface tension on the elastic
  properties of thin films and multilayered structures, which are widely used in the coating industry. Thin films can be
  considered as two-dimensional structures, and therefore require a two-dimensional continuum mechanics theory to account
  for the surface effects. The classical theory of elasticity, which neglects the surface effects, is not adequate to
  describe the behavior of them at micro scales, where the surface-to-volume ratio is high. Therefore, a non-classical
  theory of elasticity, based on the Gurtin-Murdoch model of elastic material surface, is employed to incorporate the
  surface effects. The specific problem of a thick-walled cylinder under internal and external pressure is studied using
  both classical and non-classical methods, and the results are compared and discussed. The influence of various parameters,
  such as the ratio of inner and outer radii, the surface elastic moduli, and the coating conditions, on the radial and
  tangential stresses in the cylinder is investigated. It is shown that the surface effects are more significant for
  thinner cylinders and for higher surface elastic moduli. The coating conditions also affect the stress distribution
  in the gap between the two surfaces.</p>

  <h3>Finite element analysis of wrinkling of thin elastic sheets under uniaxial extension</h3>
<p> The aim of my dissertation was to present a novel theory and method for analyzing the large deformation by
  investigating the wrinkling phenomenon of initially flat elastic thin membranes under uniaxial stretching.
  Wrinkles are commonly produced in membranes due to different in-plane loading and boundary conditions and as for many
  applications using the flexible thin sheets in their structures, it is important for researchers to understand the
  mechanics of this problem. Basically, wrinkling is an instability phenomenon and classical continuum theory encounters
  difficulties in such problems We used a gradient elasticity theory, which considers the dependence of the internal
  energy on the first and second derivatives of the deformation field for this matter and derived the equilibrium
  equations and boundary conditions using a variational approach, and proposed constitutive laws that include two
  length-scale parameters for isotropic materials. Finally, we developed a C1 finite element formulation to solve
  the highly nonlinear governing equations numerically, using the UEL subroutine of ABAQUS and show that our theory
  can capture the detailed wrinkling patterns, the lateral displacement and the precise the stresses distribution
  and nominal strains by comparing our results with experimental data.</p>
